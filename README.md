# Constantinople
A (currently) solo project by Magister. Also my(his?) first ever project.
The end goal is to use Tensorflow as main API to achieve a high level go artifical intelligence through adding non-traditional training methods.

# Progress
2019/10/12 GitHub repository created, with a board file that can allow players to play go through python shell(without counting).

2019/10/16 Project halted due to academic issues.

2019/10/31 Previously halted project restarted. First part of readsgf.py done.
